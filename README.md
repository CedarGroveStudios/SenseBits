# SenseBits
Three-pin servo connector compatible, buffered LED driver, unbuffered NeoPixel, and unbuffered piezo transducer boards.

LED SenseBit:
Supply voltage: 2 to 6 volts. LED current: 35mA source or sink maximum. Only one LED should be connected to either the SMD 0805 pads or the through-hole pads. R1 is selected based on supply voltage, the LED forward voltage, and the desired LED current level.

NeoPix SenseBit:
Supply voltage 3.3 to 5 volts. Onboard 100-ohm series resistor and 10uf filter capacitor.

Piezo SenseBit:
Uses the PKMCS0909E4000-R1 SMD piezo transducer. Supply voltage is not required.
